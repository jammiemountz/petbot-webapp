    <p>Our pets are just as important as people, and should be treated that way. At PetBot, we strengthen relationships. Everything we do is driven by this mission. That’s why we created PetBot, the first and only device that creates meaningful, true 2-way interaction between people and their pets. We’re happy to talk to people as well. Give us a shout at press@petbot.com for more information.</p>

    <h3 class='pressTitle break'>Sample News Story</h3>
    <p>There’s nothing worse than not being able to hear from someone you love for long stretches of time. If you’re a pet parent, you know that feeling all too well with your furbaby.</p>
    <p>With more and more people realizing the special connection they have with their pets shouldn’t stop when you leave the house, they are looking for ways to stay connected to their best friends.</p>
    <p>PetBot does just that. The company has developed a device that promises “true two-way interaction” between people and pets. It lets you see your pet, record and play sounds (including your own voice), and drop treats to keep them happy.</p>
    <p>But this is not just a simple pet camera. To make it the interaction truly two-way, it also lets your pet send you selfies. Not only will you get a cute video that tells you your pet is OK, you’ll also get more material to post on your (or your pet’s) social media accounts.</p>
    <p>The PetBot isn’t all about treats and cute videos. It also helps you keep track of your pet’s health and mental well-being. Its built-in Bark Recognition will notify you if your pet is making too much noise, helping potentially identify and reduce separation anxiety. On top of that, being able to record your voice means you can stay on top of their training even while you’re at the office.</p>
    <p>After a successful crowdfunding campaign and delivery of the device, PetBot is taking pre-orders of the PetBot through their website - <a href='http://www.petbot.com'>www.petbot.com</a> - from February 7 to March 7, 2017. Orders are estimated to ship in May.</p>
