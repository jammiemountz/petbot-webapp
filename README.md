# Petbot Website

## Build:
AngularJS, ES6, Webpack, Node

## Setup:
- Open your Terminal application ( on mac )
- run `cd ~/Desktop` to change location to your desktop.
- Use github to bring down a local version of the repository with `git clone https://github.com/jammiemountz/petbot-webapp.git`
- cd into the project
- run `npm install` to download all the dependencies
- run `gulp serve` to serve the application
- open a browser to `localhost:3000` to see the application

## Trouble Shooting
- You'll need gulp installed globally to run the gulp command - `npm install -g gulp`
- You'll need a Node version around 7.2.0 to get things to run. Use node version manager (NVM) to get the right version of Node.
- If webpack complains..... good luck.

## Contributing
- Master branch always contains the most up to date code.
- Check out a new branch with `git checkout -b name-of-your-branch`
- do all the codes.
- when you're ready to commit, run `git add .`, and then `git commit`
- Name your commit message (probably in vi)
- Run `git push origin name-of-your-branch`
- open a PR into master on github
